<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify; color: #0000ff;">The data relates to the actions of shoppers as they visit web store. The activity of the session is measured in 17 dimensions and we note the revenue generated by the visitor (FALSE OR TRUE). We use the UCI dataset "Internet Shoppers Purchasing Intent" concerning consumer visits to an online store and their decision to buy a product(s). The purpose of the research is to use clustering algorithms and classification algorithms to construct predictive models for certain online shoppers so that we can develop an interactive data product accordingly.</span></h3>
